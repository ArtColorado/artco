# ArtCO

See where to find your favorite Colorado artists, or find new favorites!

## [Description](#table-of-contents)

Find local Colorado artists, and see where they will be exhibiting next. Or find events, and see which artists will be there. This site allows artists to connect with their patrons, show their work, and tell potential customers where to find them. Artists can tell patrons a bit about themselves, and upload examples of their work. This site also allows patrons to search through various categories of arts and crafts to find new artists to love.
